Look! Hooknook.
---------------

Hooknook is a preposterously simple tool for deploying code from GitHub. You push to GitHub, Hooknook gets notified via a webhook, and your code does whatever it wants on the server.

You can use it to run "your own GitHub Pages," where every time you push a site's Jekyll source code to GitHub, it automatically gets built and uploaded to a server.
